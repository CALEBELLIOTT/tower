# Tower

Tower is a ticketing application where users can post, RSVP, and comment on events.

### Features

Tower allows users to log in, and view events that other users have posted. If an event has availability still, a user is able to "attend" the event and reserve their spot for that specific event. Apun doing so, the available seats counter will drop by one and if it hits 0, other users are no longer able to sign up for the event. 

Users are also able to comment on events and view other user's comments.

Users are able to create events and set specific details on that event. Once an event is created, the user who created it is able to cancel it which prevents anyone else from reserving a spot. 

Events belong to categories and events are able to be filtered on the home page. 


### Building the project

Tower is built using Vue.js, Node.js, Mongoose, and express. While I made a very good back end for this project, I emphasized the front end and feel very proud of the result. I put a lot of time into styling and took some time to experiment with built in animations within vue as well as transitions within CSS that I previously had not utilized in other projects.
